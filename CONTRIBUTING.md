# Branching

See here: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Basically, each new changeset (e.g. features or bug fixes) should have
its own branch. Changeset branches (except critical bug fixes) get
merged to the `develop` branch, and `develop` gets merged back to
`master` when a new release is ready.
